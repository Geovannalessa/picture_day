            <h3>Sharpless 249 and the Jellyfish Nebula</h3>
            <h4>Image Credit & Copyright: Eric Coles</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Explanation:</strong>  Normally faint and elusive, the Jellyfish Nebula is caught in this alluring telescopic
                mosaic. The scene is anchored below by bright star Eta Geminorum, at the foot of the celestial twin,
                while the Jellyfish Nebula is the brighter arcing ridge of emission with tentacles dangling below
                and left of center. In fact, the cosmic jellyfish is part of bubble-shaped supernova remnant IC 443,
                the expanding debris cloud from a massive star that exploded. Light from the explosion first reached
                planet Earth over 30,000 years ago. Like its cousin in astrophysical waters the Crab Nebula
                supernova remnant, the Jellyfish Nebula is known to harbor a neutron star, the remnant of the
                collapsed stellar core. An emission nebula cataloged as Sharpless 249 fills the field at the upper
                right. The Jellyfish Nebula is about 5,000 light-years away. At that distance, this narrowband
                composite image presented in the Hubble Palette would be about 300 light-years across.
